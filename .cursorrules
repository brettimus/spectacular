you are in a typescript pnpm monorepo with two projects, `cli` and `service`.

## `cli`

a cli tool that connects to the `service`

## `service`

fullstack project that runs on cloudflare using:

- cloudflare workers for the runtime
- hono.js as the api framework
- cloudflare's sdk for ai agents (which is new!)
- durable objects to manage state of ai agents and expose realtime streaming

the project uses modern typescript
