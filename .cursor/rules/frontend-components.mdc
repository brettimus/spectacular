# Adding and working with frontend components using shadcn

Try to add shadcn components when you can instead of writing UI from scratch.

To add a new shadcn component, use the custom pnpm script in @package.json: `pnpm shadd button`

Look in the directory `components/ui` for existing components

Try not to modify the components in this directory. if you want a reusable version of one of these with custom styles or behavior, define the derived component in `components` top-level directory, then reuse that across the app.
