We are building a simple CRUD API that focuses on the 'fixes' resource. We need to implement two endpoints under the /sessions/:id/fixes route. One is the POST endpoint for inserting a new fix event and the other is the GET endpoint for retrieving a list of fixes for a given session with optional filtering by 'type' and pagination. We need to use Cloudflare Workers with Hono, access environment variables via the context parameter (c.env), and use Drizzle ORM (with proper imports such as eq and desc). We also ensure to validate parameters and payloads, and use Number.parseInt for parsing query parameters. We include error handling with proper error messages and type checking. We remove the unused endpoints from the template file and only include the ones we need according to the specification. In the generated code we are not including any extra code examples that are not related to the required endpoints. We also add TODO comments for future streaming and realtime integrations if needed.
