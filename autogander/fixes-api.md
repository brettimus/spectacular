# Fixes API Specification

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for the Fixes API. The API will handle the receipt of "fixes" events for a given session and provide a way to list these fixes using various query parameters, including filtering by type and pagination.

## 1. Project Description

The Fixes API will expose two main endpoints:

- POST /sessions/:id/fixes: Receive a new fix event for a specific session.
- GET /sessions/:id/fixes: Retrieve and list fixes for a specific session, with support for filtering by fix type and pagination (default page size of 100).

Each fix event contains the following properties:

- type (string): The type/category of the fix.
- originalCode (string): The original code before applying the fix.
- errors (JSON): A JSON blob detailing the errors encountered.
- analysis (string): The analysis output derived from examining the fix.
- fix (string): The code or solution generated to address the errors.

Additionally, each fix event can be associated with many RULES. RULES are to be created later as part of a background job, but the related table and schema should be planned for in the database design.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Edge Runtime:** Cloudflare Workers
- **API Framework:** Hono.js
- **Database:** Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) as the serverless relational database
- **ORM/Query Builder:** Drizzle ORM

## 3. Database Schema Design

The design includes two tables: one for fixes and one for the fix-related RULES (even though RULES insertion will be implemented later).

### 3.1. fixes Table

This table stores all fix events. The proposed schema is as follows:

- id: INTEGER, Primary Key, Auto Increment
- session_id: STRING, to track which session the fix belongs to
- type: STRING, fix category/type
- originalCode: STRING, the code prior to the fix
- errors: JSON (or TEXT if JSON is not natively supported), the error payload
- analysis: STRING, analysis output
- fix: STRING, the actual fix provided
- created_at: TIMESTAMP, defaults to current time for sorting & pagination

### 3.2. fix_rules Table

This table will hold the RULES which are associated with a fix. Even if the RULE creation is deferred to background processes, the schema is defined as follows:

- id: INTEGER, Primary Key, Auto Increment
- fix_id: INTEGER, Foreign Key referencing fixes.id
- rule: STRING, details or identifier for the rule
- additional_data: JSON (if additional rule-related data is needed)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP, defaults to current time

## 4. API Endpoints

The API endpoints are designed to both create and retrieve fix events, grouped logically by session.

### 4.1. POST /sessions/:id/fixes

- **Description:** Insert a new fix event for the session specified by the `:id` parameter.
- **URL Parameter:**
  - id: The session identifier for which the fix event is being recorded.
- **Payload:**

  ```json
  {
    "type": "errorType",
    "originalCode": "// original code snippet",
    "errors": { "error_key": "error_value" },
    "analysis": "Detailed analysis...",
    "fix": "Corrected code snippet"
  }
  ```

- **Implementation Details:**
  - Validate the session id parameter.
  - Validate incoming JSON payload for required fields. (Additional validation may be added, such as JSON schema validation.)
  - Insert the record into the `fixes` table with the current timestamp.
  - Return a success response with the created fix recordâ€™s details.

### 4.2. GET /sessions/:id/fixes

- **Description:** List and paginate fix events for a given session, with optional filtering by `type`.
- **URL Parameter:**
  - id: The session identifier whose fixes should be retrieved.
- **Query Parameters:**
  - type: (optional) Filter fixes by a specific type.
  - page: (optional) The page number, defaulting to 1 if not provided.
  - pageSize: (optional) The number of records per page, defaults to 100.

- **Response:**

  ```json
  {
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 100,
    "total": 250,
    "fixes": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "session_id": "abc123",
        "type": "errorType",
        "originalCode": "...",
        "errors": { "error_key": "error_value" },
        "analysis": "Detailed analysis...",
        "fix": "Corrected code snippet",
        "created_at": "2023-10-10T12:00:00Z"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- **Implementation Details:**
  - Validate the session id parameter.
  - Read and apply pagination and filter parameters.
  - Query the `fixes` table using Drizzle ORM, filtering by session_id and type if provided.
  - Order the list by `created_at` descending (if preferred) and return the paginated results.

## 5. Additional Integrations

- **Database Access:** Use Drizzle ORM for type-safe access to Cloudflare D1.
- **Background Jobs (Future):** Prepare for later integration of background jobs to process fixes and generate RULES. This could later be implemented using Cloudflare Durable Objects or other background processing services.

## 6. Future Considerations

- DEVELOP RULES: Implement the background job to analyze fix events and generate corresponding RULES that will be inserted into the `fix_rules` table.
- ERROR HANDLING: Enhance error handling, logging, and validation for production use.
- METRICS: Incorporate logging and metrics to monitor the number of fixes processed per session.
- SECURITY: Even though no authentication is required initially, consider integrating Clerk for user authentication if access control is needed in the future.
