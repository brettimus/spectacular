  "specName": "Dog Fashion Recommendations API",
  "specContent": "## Overview\n\nThe Dog Fashion Recommendations API is designed to provide dog fashion recommendations based on both image analysis and user-provided inputs. Users can upload a photo of their dog and provide additional details (breed, description, etc.). The system will store the uploaded image, run a placeholder image analysis to identify dog characteristics, and then generate fashion recommendations based on the combined inputs.\n\n## Architecture & Components\n\n1. **Cloudflare Workers with Hono Framework**\n   - Use Hono for routing and handling HTTP requests.\n   \n2. **Cloudflare R2 (Blob Storage)**\n   - Store and serve uploaded dog photos.\n\n3. **Cloudflare D1 with Drizzle (Database)**\n   - Persist user submissions, including metadata (e.g., image path, user description, breed, etc.).\n   - Suggested table: `submissions`.\n\n4. **Image Analysis Placeholder**\n   - A stub function that simulates image processing. Can later be integrated using a specialized ML service.\n\n5. **Recommendation Engine (Placeholder)**\n   - A function that returns static or dummy fashion recommendations based on user input and the analysis output.\n\n## API Endpoints\n\n### 1. POST /submit\n\n- **Purpose:** Accepts a user's dog photo along with additional inputs.\n\n- **Request:**\n  - Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`\n  - Fields:\n    - `photo`: file upload of the dog's image\n    - `description`: text field with additional dog details/preferences\n    - `breed` (optional): user-provided breed information\n    - Any other fields as needed (e.g., dog size, style preferences)\n\n- **Processing Flow:**\n  1. Parse the multipart form data.\n  2. Upload the photo to Cloudflare R2 and obtain a file URL/path.\n  3. Call the placeholder image analysis function to process the photo. (This function will eventually return calculated characteristics such as breed and size.)\n  4. Merge the analysis results with the user-provided data.\n  5. Save the submission record in Cloudflare D1 using Drizzle (include fields such as id, dogBreed, description, image URL, created_at, etc.).\n  6. Return a JSON response confirming submission success and reference ID of the submission.\n\n### 2. GET /recommendations\n\n- **Purpose:** Return dog fashion recommendations based on submission criteria.\n\n- **Query Parameters:**\n  - `submissionId` (optional): If provided, the system fetches the specific submission details and tailors the recommendations to that dog's characteristics.\n  - Alternatively, query parameters like `breed`, `dogSize`, etc. could be supported directly.\n\n- **Processing Flow:**\n  1. If a `submissionId` is provided, fetch the submission record from the database.\n  2. Otherwise, use the query parameters to determine the recommendation criteria.\n  3. Call the recommendation engine placeholder that returns a list of static/dummy fashion recommendations (e.g., a set of fashionable collars, jackets, etc.).\n  4. Return the recommendations in JSON format.\n\n## Database Schema (Cloudflare D1 with Drizzle)\n\nCreate a table called `submissions`:\n\n- Columns:\n  - id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT\n  - photo_url: TEXT (R2 object URL/path)\n  - description: TEXT\n  - breed: TEXT\n  - analyzed_breed: TEXT (returned from image analysis placeholder)\n  - created_at: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n\n## Placeholder Functions\n\n### 1. Image Analysis Placeholder\n\n- Function: `analyzeDogPhoto(file: File): Promise<{ analyzedBreed: string, size: string }>`\n- Implementation: For now, return a dummy object such as `{ analyzedBreed: 'Labrador', size: 'Medium' }`.\n\n### 2. Recommendation Engine Placeholder\n\n- Function: `getRecommendations(criteria: { breed: string, size: string, description?: string }): Array<{ item: string, description: string, link: string }>`\n- Implementation: Return a static list of recommendation objects, e.g., \n  ```typescript\n  return [\n    { item: 'Stylish Dog Jacket', description: 'A trendy and warm jacket for your medium-sized Labrador.', link: 'https://example.com/jacket' },\n    { item: 'Designer Collar', description: 'A collar that combines comfort with style.', link: 'https://example.com/collar' }\n  ];\n  ```\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Project Setup**\n   - Initialize a new Cloudflare Workers project using your preferred CLI.\n   - Install TypeScript and necessary dependencies: Hono, Drizzle, any multipart form parser.\n\n2. **Environment Variables & Configuration**\n   - Configure environment variables for Cloudflare R2 and D1 access credentials.\n   - Setup Workers configuration (wrangler.toml) to bind these services.\n\n3. **Routing with Hono**\n   - Create route handlers for `POST /submit` and `GET /recommendations`.\n   - Apply any middleware (e.g., parsing multipart form data) if needed.\n\n4. **File Upload Handling**\n   - In the `POST /submit` endpoint, parse the incoming multipart form data.\n   - Use the Cloudflare Workers API to stream the file to R2 and generate a URL for storage.\n\n5. **Database Operations**\n   - Use Drizzle to create a model for the `submissions` table.\n   - In the `POST /submit` endpoint, store the submission record containing user details and the R2 photo URL.\n\n6. **Integrate Placeholder Functions**\n   - Implement the `analyzeDogPhoto` function which returns dummy analysis data.\n   - Implement the `getRecommendations` function that creates a static list of recommendations based on input.\n\n7. **Error Handling & Logging**\n   - Ensure all endpoints have robust error catching.\n   - Log errors where applicable using Cloudflare Workers logging.\n\n8. **Testing**\n   - Create local tests for file upload handling, routing, and database insertion.\n   - Test endpoints with sample data (e.g., using Postman or an automated test suite).\n\n9. **Documentation**\n   - Document the API endpoints with examples of requests and responses in a README.md file or using an API documentation tool.\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- Integrate a real image analysis service or machine learning model/API for detecting the dog breed and size automatically.\n- Add authentication with Clerk if you plan to allow users to have accounts and manage their submissions.\n- Enhance the recommendation engine to be dynamic by integrating with a dog fashion product catalog or third-party service.\n- Implement caching strategies for frequently requested recommendations.\n\nThis detailed plan should provide all necessary guidelines to begin the implementation of the Dog Fashion Recommendations API using Cloudflare Workers, Hono, Cloudflare R2, and Cloudflare D1 with Drizzle.\n",
