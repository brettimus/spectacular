# Document Word Frequency API Implementation Plan

This document outlines the design and step-by-step implementation plan for an API that takes in a plain text document and returns the list of the top 10 most frequent words along with the total word count. The API is built using Cloudflare Workers with Hono.js.

## 1. Project Description

The Document Word Frequency API is designed to process plain text provided via a JSON request body, perform text analysis to count the frequency of each word, and return the results in a JSON response. The response includes the total word count as well as the top 10 most numerous words with their counts.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Edge Runtime:** Cloudflare Workers
- **API Framework:** Hono.js
- **Language:** TypeScript (leveraging type safety)

There is no need for a database, authentication, or additional integrations since the API is stateless and solely performs text analysis.

## 3. API Endpoint

### 3.1. POST /analyze

- **Description:** This endpoint accepts a JSON request body with a property `text` containing the plain text document, processes the text to compute word counts, and delivers a JSON response with:
  - `totalWords`: An integer representing the total number of words in the document.
  - `topWords`: An array of objects, each representing a word and its count, sorted by frequency in descending order. Only the top 10 are included.

- **Request Body Example:**

```json
{
  "text": "Your text content here..."
}
```

- **Response Example:**

```json
{
  "totalWords": 123,
  "topWords": [
    { "word": "example", "count": 10 },
    { "word": "test", "count": 8 },
    ...
  ]
}
```

- **Flow/Logic:**
  1. Validate the request body to ensure a `text` property is provided and is a non-empty string.
  2. Normalize the text (e.g., convert to lower case, remove punctuation if necessary) to standardize word counting.
  3. Tokenize the text into words. Consider splitting on whitespace and handling punctuation boundaries.
  4. Iterate over the tokens to build a frequency map (using a dictionary / hash map).
  5. Calculate the total word count from the frequency map.
  6. Sort the frequency map entries in descending order of frequency.
  7. Return the top 10 words (or fewer if there arenâ€™t enough unique words) along with their counts.

## 4. Additional Considerations

- **Input Validation:** Handle cases where the request JSON is malformed or the `text` field is missing or empty. Respond with appropriate error status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request).
- **Normalization:** Decide on text normalization steps (e.g., treating 'Word' and 'word' as the same, removing punctuation, etc.)
- **Performance:** The text analysis is done in-memory. For extremely large texts, consider whether additional optimizations or stream processing may be required.
- **Error Handling:** Use appropriate error handling to catch any unexpected exceptions during text processing and return a 500 Internal Server Error if needed.

## 5. Future Considerations

- **Extended Text Analysis:** In the future, consider expanding the API to return additional text statistics such as sentence count, average word length, etc.
- **Caching:** For repeated requests with the same input (if applicable), implement a caching layer at the edge to improve performance.
- **Analytics:** Introduce logging and monitoring to capture the usage patterns of the API.
- **Scaling:** Although not required for this basic API, if the traffic increases, consider performing performance tests and optimizations at the Cloudflare Workers edge.

## 6. Deployment Configuration

- Create a Cloudflare Workers project using Wrangler.
- Configure the wrangler.toml to deploy to the appropriate Cloudflare Workers environment.
- Use TypeScript with Hono.js for developing the API.

## 7. Further Reading

- Hono.js documentation for additional API handling details.
- Cloudflare Workers documentation for deployment and edge runtime guidelines.

This plan should provide a clear roadmap to implement the Document Word Frequency API using the HONC stack: Hono.js, Cloudflare Workers, with TypeScript.
