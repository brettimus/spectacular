Here is an example:\n\n```ts\napp.get('/', (c) => {\n  return c.render(\n    <Suspense fallback={<div>loading...</div>}>\n      <AsyncComponent />\n    </Suspense>\n  )\n})\n```\n\nWhen rendering the JSX, Hono can also set certain headers for the response. By default, if `true` is set, the following headers are added:\n\n```ts\n{\n  'Transfer-Encoding': 'chunked',\n  'Content-Type': 'text/html; charset=UTF-8',\n  'Content-Encoding': 'Identity'\n}\n```\n\nYou can customize these headers by specifying the Record values.\n\nHono also supports nested layouts through the `Layout` component.

The `Hono` class is imported from the 'hono' module.\n2. A new instance of `Hono` is created and assigned to the `app` variable.\n3. The `get` method of the `app` object is used to define a route that responds to HTTP GET requests at the root URL ('/'). The route handler function takes a context object `c` and returns a text response 'Hello Hono!'.\n4. The `app` object is exported for use in other modules.\n\n### Important notes\n\n- The route handler function can return a response in different formats, such as text, HTML, or JSON, using the appropriate methods of the context object.\n\n### References\n\n- [Hono documentation](https://hono.bun.dev/)\n\n### Common use cases\n\n- Building a simple web server with Hono\n- Defining routes and route handlers in a Hono application",

      "ruleFile": "## Handling GET Requests and Manipulating Responses in Hono\n\nThe following code snippets demonstrate how to handle GET requests and manipulate responses in Hono.\n\nTo handle a GET request to `/api/hello` and return a JSON response, you can use the `get` method of the `app` object and the `json` method of the context `c`:\n\n```ts\napp.get('/api/hello', (c) => {\n  return c.json({\n    ok: true,\n    message: 'Hello Hono!',\n  })\n})\n```\n\nTo get a path parameter, a URL query value, and append a response header, you can use the `req` and `header` methods of the context `c`:\n\n```ts\napp.get('/posts/:id', (c) => {\n  const page = c.req.query('page')\n  const id = c.req.param('id')\n  c.header('X-Message', 'Hi!')\n  return c.text(`You want to see ${page} of ${id}`)\n})\n```\n\n### How it Works\n\nIn Hono, the `app.get` method is used to handle GET requests. The first argument is the path, and the second argument is a callback function that takes a context `c` as its argument. The context `c` has several methods to manipulate the request and the response. The `req.query` method is used to get a URL query value, the `req.param` method is used to get a path parameter, and the `header` method is used to append a response header.\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- The `req.query` and `req.param` methods return `undefined` if the specified query or parameter does not exist.\n- The `header` method does not return anything.\n\n### References\n\n- [Hono Documentation](https://hono.boutell.com/)\n\n### Common Use Cases\n\n- Building APIs that handle GET requests.\n- Building APIs that need to extract path parameters and query values.\n- Building APIs that need to manipulate response headers.",

We then define two functional components, `Layout` and `Top`, using the `FC` (Functional Component) type from Hono's JSX module.\n3. The `Layout` component takes in `props` and returns an HTML structure with `{props.children}` as the body content.\n4. The `Top` component takes in `props` with a `messages` array and returns the `Layout` component with a list of messages.\n5. In the Hono route handler for the root path (`/`), we return the `Top` component with a `messages` array as the HTML response.\n\n### Important notes\n\n- The `FC` type is used to define functional components in Hono with TypeScript.\n- The `props` argument in functional components is used to pass data to the components.\n\n### References\n\n- [Hono Documentation](https://hono.bun.js.org/)\n\n### Common use cases\n\n- Creating dynamic HTML responses in Hono routes using JSX syntax.",

      "ruleFile": "## Rule: Defining Routes in Hono to Return HTML and Text Responses\n\nThis rule demonstrates how to define routes in Hono that return HTML and text responses. The 'get' method is used to handle HTTP GET requests to specific paths ('/html/' and '/text/'), and the 'html' and 'text' methods are used to send responses of different types.\n\n### Code Snippet:\n\n```ts\n// save to ./static/html/index.html\napp.get('/html/', (c) => c.html('html'))\n\n// save to ./static/text/index.txt\napp.get('/text/', (c) => c.text('text'))\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n\n1. The 'get' method is used to define a route that handles HTTP GET requests. The first argument is the path, and the second argument is a callback function that is executed when the route is matched.\n\n2. The callback function takes a context object 'c' as an argument. This object contains information about the HTTP request and has methods for sending a response.\n\n3. The 'html' and 'text' methods of the context object are used to send HTML and text responses, respectively.\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n- The paths in the 'get' method calls end with a slash. This means that the routes will match requests to '/html/' and '/text/', but not to '/html' and '/text'.\n\n- The 'html' and 'text' methods automatically set the correct 'Content-Type' HTTP header in the response ('text/html' and 'text/plain', respectively).\n\n### References:\n\n- [Hono Documentation](https://hono.boutell.com/)\n\n### Common Use Cases:\n\n- Use the 'html' method to send an HTML response when you want to render a web page.\n\n- Use the 'text' method to send a text response when you want to send plain text data, for example, as a response to an API request.",

The `ssgParams` middleware is used to generate static parameters for the route '/shops/:id'. It fetches a list of shops and returns an array of objects, each containing an `id` property.\n\n2. In the route handler, it fetches the shop with the requested `id` and renders a response. If the shop is not found, it returns a 404 response.\n\nThis approach allows you to generate static pages for each shop at build time, improving the performance of your application.\n\n**Important notes:**\n\n- The `ssgParams` middleware is similar to the `generateStaticParams` API in Next.js.\n- Routes with the `disableSSG` middleware set are excluded from static file generation.\n\n**Common use cases:**\n\n- Pre-rendering pages at build time for performance benefits.\n- Handling routes with dynamic parameters.\n\n**References:**\n\n- [Hono documentation](https://hono.dev/docs)\n- [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)",

Finally, it shows how to delete a response header before returning the response.\n\n```ts\napp.get('/proxy/:path', async (c) => {\n  const res = await proxy(\n    `http://${originServer}/${c.req.param('path')}',\n    {\n      headers: {\n        ...c.req.header(), // optional, specify only when forwarding all the request data (including credentials) is necessary.\n        'X-Forwarded-For': '127.0.0.1',\n        'X-Forwarded-Host': c.req.header('host'),\n        Authorization: undefined, // do not propagate request headers contained in c.req.header('Authorization')\n      },\n    }\n  )\n  res.headers.delete('Set-Cookie')\n  return res\n})\n```\n\n### How it works\n\nThe proxy helper is used to forward the request to another server. The path to the other server is specified in the first argument to the proxy function. The second argument is an options object, where you can specify headers to be included in the forwarded request. You can forward all request data by spreading `c.req.header()`, set specific headers, or prevent certain headers from being propagated by setting them to `undefined`. After the request is forwarded and the response is received, you can manipulate the response headers before returning the response.\n\n### Important notes\n\n- Be careful when forwarding all request data, as it might include sensitive information like credentials.\n- When setting the 'X-Forwarded-For' and 'X-Forwarded-Host' headers, make sure to use the correct values.\n- Deleting a response header might affect the behavior of the client that receives the response.\n\n### References\n\n- [Hono documentation](https://hono.beebotte.com/docs)\n\n### Common use cases\n\n- Forwarding requests to another server in a microservices architecture.\n- Implementing a reverse proxy.",
