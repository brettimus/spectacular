### Creating a Basic Hono Application and Starting a New Project

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a basic Hono application and how to start a new Hono project using different package managers.

```ts twoslash
import { Hono } from 'hono'
const app = new Hono()

app.get('/', (c) => c.text('Hono!'))

export default app
sh [npm]
npm create hono@latest
sh [yarn]
yarn create hono
sh [pnpm]
pnpm create hono@latest
sh [bun]
bun create hono@latest
sh [deno]
deno init --npm hono@latest
```

The `Hono` class is imported from the `hono` package. An instance of `Hono` is created and a GET route is defined for the root URL (`/`). The route handler function takes a context object `c` and sends a text response 'Hono!'.

To start a new project, the `create` command is used with the package manager. This command creates a new Hono project with the latest version.

- The `create` command may vary depending on the package manager.

#### Code Snippet

```typescript

To start a new Hono project, you can use the following commands depending on the package manager you are using:

```

**Reasoning:** This rule is important as it demonstrates how to create a basic Hono application and how to start a new Hono project using different package managers. Understanding this rule is crucial for developers to get started with Hono.

### Creating a new Hono project and understanding its features, use-cases, and who is using it

You can create a new Hono project using different package managers. Here are the commands for npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, and deno:

```sh
npm create hono@latest
sh
yarn create hono
sh
pnpm create hono@latest
sh
bun create hono@latest
sh
deno init --npm hono@latest
```

Hono is a simple web application framework that is ultrafast, lightweight, and works on multiple runtimes. It has built-in middleware, custom middleware, third-party middleware, and helpers. It also has first-class TypeScript support.

Hono can be used for building Web APIs, proxy of backend servers, front of CDN, edge application, base server for a library, and full-stack application.

Hono is used by various projects such as cdnjs, Cloudflare D1, Cloudflare Workers KV, BaseAI, Unkey, OpenStatus, Deno Benchmarks, Clerk, Drivly, and repeat.dev.

### Understanding Hono's Lightweight Nature

This code snippet demonstrates the lightweight nature of the Hono web framework. With the `hono/tiny` preset, its size is under 14KB when minified. This is significantly smaller compared to other web frameworks like Express, which is 572KB in size. This makes Hono a more efficient choice for developers who are concerned about the performance of their web applications.

```text
See [more benchmarks](/docs/concepts/benchmarks).

**Hono is so small**. With the `hono/tiny` preset, its size is **under 14KB** when minified. There are many middleware and adapters, but they are bundled only when used. For context, the size of Express is 572KB.
```

Hono achieves its small size by only bundling middleware and adapters when they are used. This means that unused features do not contribute to the overall size of the application.

- The size of the Hono framework can vary depending on the middleware and adapters used.

- Building lightweight web applications
- Building web applications where performance is a key concern

**Reasoning:** This rule is important as it demonstrates the lightweight nature of the Hono web framework. It shows that Hono, when minified, is significantly smaller in size compared to other web frameworks like Express. This is crucial for developers who are concerned about the performance and efficiency of their web applications.

### Understanding Key Features of Hono Framework

This code snippet provides an overview of the key features of the Hono web framework.

```text

Hono has multiple routers. RegExpRouter is the fastest router in the JavaScript world. It matches the route using a single large Regex created before dispatch. With SmartRouter, it supports all route patterns.

LinearRouter registers the routes very quickly, so it's suitable for an environment that initializes applications every time. PatternRouter simply adds and matches the pattern, making it small.

Thanks to the use of the Web Standards, Hono works on a lot of platforms.

- Cloudflare Workers
- Cloudflare Pages
- Fastly Compute
- Deno
- Bun
- Vercel
- AWS Lambda
- Lambda@Edge
- Others

And by using a Node.js adapter, Hono works on Node.js.

Hono has many middleware and helpers. This makes 'Write Less, do more' a reality.

Out of the box, Hono provides middleware and helpers for:

- Basic Authentication
- Bearer Authentication
- Body Limit
- Cache
- Compress
- Context Storage
- Cookie
- CORS
- ETag
- html
- JSX
- JWT Authentication
- Logger
- Language
- Pretty JSON
- Secure Headers
- SSG
- Streaming
- GraphQL Server
- Firebase Authentication
- Sentry
- Others!

For example, adding ETag and request logging only takes a few lines of code with Hono:
```

Hono provides a variety of routers, each with their own strengths and use cases. It also adheres to web standards, making it compatible with a wide range of platforms. Additionally, Hono provides a multitude of middleware and helpers to streamline development.

Understanding the different routers, the platforms Hono supports, and the available middleware and helpers is crucial for effective use of the Hono framework.

- [Hono Documentation](https://honojs.com/docs)

Hono can be used in a variety of web development scenarios, from creating serverless applications to building robust APIs.

**Reasoning:** This rule is important as it demonstrates the versatility and flexibility of the Hono web framework. It shows how Hono supports multiple routers, adheres to web standards, and provides a wide range of middleware and helpers. Understanding these features allows developers to effectively use Hono in various environments and for various use cases.
