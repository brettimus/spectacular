# Drizzle SQLite Rules

## Code Snippet 2:

```

**Reasoning:** This rule is important as it demonstrates two different ways of exporting a Hono instance in a module. The first method is more verbose and allows for additional logic to be added in the fetch function if needed. The second method is more concise and is suitable when no additional logic is needed in the fetch function.

### Initializing and Exporting a Hono Application

This code snippet demonstrates how to initialize a new Hono application and export it for use in other modules. It also shows how to override the default settings of the application by exporting an object with custom properties.

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
const app = new Hono()
// ---cut---
export default app
ts
export default app // [!code --]
export default {  // [!code ++]
  port: 3000, // [!code ++]
  fetch: app.fetch, // [!code ++]
} // [!code ++]
```

1. The `Hono` class is imported from the 'hono' module.
2. A new instance of `Hono` is created and assigned to the `app` constant.
3. The `app` constant is then exported as the default export of the module.
4. Alternatively, you can export an object with custom properties. This object includes the `port` property set to 3000 and the `fetch` method of the `app` instance.

- The `fetch` method is a useful method for making HTTP requests.

### Exporting an Application and Using request Method in Hono

In Hono, you can export your application with additional configurations. This is demonstrated in the following code snippet:

```ts
export default app // [!code --]
export default {  // [!code ++]
  port: 3000, // [!code ++]
  fetch: app.fetch, // [!code ++]
} // [!code ++]
ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
const app = new Hono()
declare const test: (name: string, fn: () => void) => void
declare const expect: (value: any) => any
// ---cut---
test('GET /hello is ok'
```

This is a common use case when testing your application's endpoints.

- When exporting your application, ensure to include all necessary configurations.
- The `request` method is a powerful tool for testing, use it to ensure your endpoints are working as expected.

- Hono Documentation

- Exporting an application with specific configurations
- Testing endpoints with the `request` method

#### Code Snippet

```typescript

This allows you to specify the port and fetch method for your application.

The `request` method is a useful tool for testing in Hono. You can pass a URL or pathname to send a GET request, and `app` will return a `Response` object. This is demonstrated in the following code snippet:

```

**Reasoning:** This rule is important as it demonstrates how to correctly export an application in Hono. It also shows how to use the `request` method for testing, which is a common use case in Hono framework.

### Testing Routes in Hono

This code snippet demonstrates how to test routes in the Hono framework.

```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
const app = new Hono()
declare const test: (name: string, fn: () => void) => void
declare const expect: (value: any) => any

test('GET /hello is ok', async () => {
  const res = await app.request('/hello')
  expect(res.status).toBe(200)
})
```

1. We first import the `Hono` class and create an instance of it.
2. We declare the `test` and `expect` functions. These are usually provided by a testing library like Jest.
3. We define a test for the `GET /hello` route. We send a request to this route using the `request` method of the `app` instance.
4. We check the status of the response. We expect it to be `200`, which means the request was successful.

- The `request` method returns a `Promise` that resolves to the response. We need to use the `await` keyword to wait for the promise to resolve.

- [Hono documentation](https://hono.bevry.me/)

- Testing the functionality of routes in a web application.

**Reasoning:** This rule is important as it demonstrates how to test routes in the Hono framework. It shows how to send a request to a specific route and how to check the status of the response. This is a fundamental part of developing and testing web applications, ensuring that the routes are working as expected.

*Source: docs/api/hono.md*

### Testing POST Requests in Hono

This code snippet demonstrates how to test a POST request in Hono. It creates a request, sends it to the Hono application, and then checks the response status.

```ts
test('POST /message is ok', async () => {
  const req = new Request('Hello!', {
    method: 'POST',
  })
  const res = await app.request(req)
  expect(res.status).toBe(201)
})
```

1. A test is defined with the description 'POST /message is ok'.
2. A new Request is created with the message 'Hello!' and the method set to 'POST'.
3. The request is sent to the Hono application using the `app.request()` method.
4. The response status is checked to be 201, indicating that the request was successful and a new resource was created.

- The `app.request()` method is used to send the request to the Hono application.
- The `expect()` function is used to check the response status.

- [Hono documentation](https://hono.bike/)

- Testing how your Hono application responds to different types of requests.
- Checking that your application behaves as expected when it receives a POST request.

**Reasoning:** This rule is important as it demonstrates how to test a POST request in Hono. It shows how to create a request, send it to the Hono application, and then check the response status. This is a fundamental aspect of ensuring that the application behaves as expected when it receives a POST request.

### Managing Route Matching in Hono Using Strict Mode

In Hono, the strict mode is used to manage route matching. By default, the strict mode is set to `true` and it distinguishes between similar routes. For example, `/hello` and `/hello/` are treated as different routes.

```text
Strict mode defaults to `true` and distinguishes the following routes.

- `/hello`
- `/hello/`

`app.get('/hello')` will not match `GET /hello/`.
text
By setting strict mode to `false`, both paths will be treated equally.
```

When you create a new Hono application, you can set the strict mode in the options. If you set it to `false`, the trailing slashes in the routes will be ignored.

- The strict mode only affects the trailing slashes in the routes.

- [Hono Documentation](https://hono.bouzuya.net/)

- When you want to treat `/hello` and `/hello/` as the same route, you can set the strict mode to `false`.

#### Code Snippet

```typescript

However, you can make the route matching less strict by setting the strict mode to `false`. In this case, both `/hello` and `/hello/` will be treated as the same route.

```

**Reasoning:** This rule is important as it demonstrates how to manage route matching in Hono framework using the strict mode. It shows how the strict mode can be used to distinguish between similar routes and how to make the route matching less strict by setting the strict mode to false.

### Specifying a Different Router in Hono

In Hono, the default router is 'SmartRouter'. If you want to use a different router, like 'RegExpRouter', you can do so by passing it to a new Hono instance. Here is a code snippet demonstrating this:

```ts twoslash
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { RegExpRouter } from 'hono/router/reg-exp-router'

const app = new Hono({ router: new RegExpRouter() })
```

In this code snippet, we first import the 'Hono' and 'RegExpRouter' modules. Then, we create a new instance of 'Hono', passing an object with a 'router' property set to a new instance of 'RegExpRouter'. This tells Hono to use 'RegExpRouter' for routing instead of the default 'SmartRouter'.

- You can use any router that is compatible with Hono by following this pattern.

- [Hono Documentation](https://hono.bevry.me/)

- When you need to use a different routing mechanism in your Hono application.

**Reasoning:** This rule is important as it demonstrates how to specify a different router in Hono. By default, Hono uses the 'SmartRouter'. However, if a user wants to use a different router, like 'RegExpRouter', they can do so by passing it to a new Hono instance. This flexibility allows developers to choose the routing mechanism that best suits their application's needs.

### Using Generics in Hono to Specify Types of Cloudflare Workers Bindings and Variables

In Hono, you can use Generics to specify the types of Cloudflare Workers Bindings and variables used in `c.set`/`c.get`. This is useful for maintaining type safety and ensuring the correct usage of variables and bindings.

Here is a code snippet demonstrating this:

```ts twoslash
import { Hono } from 'hono'
type User = any
declare const user: User
// ---cut---
type Bindings = {
  TOKEN: string
}

type Variables = {
  user: User
}

const app = new Hono<{
  Bindings:
```

In this code snippet, a generic is used to specify the types of the `TOKEN` binding and the `user` variable. This ensures that these elements are used correctly in the code, and any misuse will be caught by the TypeScript compiler.

- Generics in Hono are a powerful tool for maintaining type safety and ensuring correct usage of variables and bindings.

- Misuse of variables and bindings can lead to runtime errors, so it's important to use generics to catch these errors at compile time.

- [Hono Documentation](https://hono.boutell.com/)

- Defining the types of Cloudflare Workers Bindings and variables used in `c.set`/`c.get`.

**Reasoning:** This rule is important as it demonstrates how to use Generics in Hono to specify the types of Cloudflare Workers Bindings and variables used in `c.set`/`c.get`. This is crucial for type safety and ensuring the correct usage of variables and bindings.

### Importing and Using Different Versions of Hono

This code snippet demonstrates how to import and use different versions of Hono, and how to instantiate routers in each version.

```ts
// Importing Hono
import { Hono } from 'hono'

// Instantiating routers in Hono
this.router = new SmartRouter({
  routers: [new RegExpRouter(), new TrieRouter()],
})

// Importing Hono Quick
import { Hono } from 'hono/quick'

// Instantiating routers in Hono Quick
this.router = new SmartRouter({
  routers: [new LinearRouter(), new TrieRouter()],
})
```

In the first part, we import the main Hono package and instantiate a SmartRouter with a RegExpRouter and a TrieRouter. In the second part, we import the 'quick' version of Hono and instantiate a SmartRouter with a LinearRouter and a TrieRouter.

Different versions of Hono may have different performance characteristics and features. Choose the version that best fits your application's needs.

- Hono Documentation

- When you need to use different routing strategies in your application.
- When you need to switch between different versions of Hono based on performance requirements or feature availability.

**Reasoning:** This rule is important as it demonstrates how to import and use different versions of Hono, and how to instantiate routers in each version. Understanding this rule allows developers to utilize the appropriate version of Hono based on their specific needs and constraints.

### Using Different Presets in Hono Framework

This rule demonstrates how to use different presets in Hono framework. The presets 'hono/quick' and 'hono/tiny' are used in this example.

For 'hono/quick':

```ts twoslash
import { Hono } from 'hono/quick'

this.router = new SmartRouter({
  routers: [new LinearRouter(), new TrieRouter()],
})
ts twoslash
import { Hono } from 'hono/tiny'

this.router = new PatternRouter()
```

The 'hono/quick' preset uses a SmartRouter with LinearRouter and TrieRouter. The 'hono/tiny' preset uses a PatternRouter.

Choose the preset based on the specific needs of your application. The 'hono/quick' preset is suitable for more complex routing needs, while the 'hono/tiny' preset is suitable for simpler routing needs.

- Hono Documentation
